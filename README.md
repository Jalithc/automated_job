# Scheduled Job Execution with Python

This script demonstrates how to schedule and execute jobs at specified intervals using the `schedule` library in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `schedule` library (Install using `pip install schedule`)

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the `schedule` library by running `pip install schedule`.
3. Run the script using the following command:


## Description

The `scheduled_jobs.py` script schedules and executes a job at various intervals using the `schedule` library:

- Every 10 minutes
- Every hour
- At 3:05 PM every day
- Every Monday
- Every Wednesday at 1:15 PM
- Every minute at 17 seconds past the minute

The `job()` function simply prints "I'm working..." when executed.

The script continuously checks for pending jobs to run using `schedule.run_pending()` and sleeps for 1 second in between checks.

Feel free to customize the job function and scheduling intervals according to your requirements.
